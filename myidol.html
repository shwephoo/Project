<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>
    Gomez was born when her mother was sixteen years old.  The family had financial troubles throughout Gomez's childhood, her mother struggling to provide for the pair. At one point, Gomez recalls that they had to search for quarters just to get gas for their car. Her mother later recalled that the two would frequently walk to their local dollar store to purchase spaghetti for dinner. Gomez stated, "I was frustrated that my parents weren't together, and never saw the light at the end of the tunnel where my mom was working hard to provide a better life for me. I'm terrified of what I would have become if I'd stayed [in Texas]." She later added that "[My mom] was really strong around me. Having me at 16 had to have been a big responsibility. She gave up everything for me, had three jobs, supported me, sacrificed her life for me."Gomez had a close relationship with her grandparents as a child and appeared in various pageants growing up. Her grandparents often took care of her while her parents finished their schooling, and she went as far as stating that they "raised her" until she found success in show business.

    Gomez is described as a pop artist with a mezzo-soprano vocal range . Her work is primarily characterised as dance-pop  and EDM however, she has experimented with different music genres. Her debut album with the Scene  was influenced by electronic rock and pop rock, while her subsequent records with the band opted for a dance-pop sound. A Year Without Rain  noted synth-pop characteristics, and When the Sun Goes Down featured a more electropop and electro-disco musical direction. Her debut solo album Stars Dance was rooted in the EDM-pop genre—Gomez herself described it as "baby dubstep drawing elements from electronic disco, techno, and dancehall. Her songs "The Heart Wants What It Wants and "Good for You" have been described as "minimalistic" and "grown-up", introducing a more adult pop sound into her repertoire.
